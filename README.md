# pfcrender
A tool for the visualization of Lindenmeyer system (lsys) iterates

# Planned features
- Rendering of user-specified lsys computed until a user-specified iterate to screen
- Generation of beveled turns for better visualzation of non-intersection of a PFC
- export of the above to several formats, including pdf, svg, tikz-picture for latex import, rasterization to some bitmapped image format e.g. jpg, png
- Commandline access to all non-interactive features of the GUI
- Operation on Linux, OSX and Windows systems
