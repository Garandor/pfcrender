# Documentation
The documentation for this project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://garandor.github.io/pfcrender/)  and re-generated by doxygen on every master branch commit build on Travis CI

# Planned features
- Rendering of user-specified lsys computed until a user-specified iterate to screen
- Generation of beveled turns for better visualzation of non-intersection of a PFC
- export of the above to several formats, including pdf, svg, tikz-picture for latex import, rasterization to some bitmapped image format e.g. jpg, png
- Commandline access to all non-interactive features of the GUI
- Operation on Linux, OSX and Windows systems
